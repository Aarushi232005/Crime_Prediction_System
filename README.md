## 🧠 Features

- **Data Preprocessing**:Cleans and prepares crime data for analysis
- **Model Training**:Utilizes machine learning algorithms to learn patterns from historical crime data
- **Prediction**:Predicts the likelihood of crimes occurring in specific areas
- **Web Interface**:Provides a user-friendly interface for users to input data and view predictions

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

1. **Data Collection & Preprocessing**:
    Gathers historical crime data and preprocesses it for model training.
2. **Model Development**:
    Trains machine learning models to recognize patterns in the data.
3. **Prediction Module**:
    Uses the trained model to predict potential crime occurrence.
4. **Web Interface**:
    Allows users to input data and view predictions through a web application.
